1.to create an instance by using terraform
2.by usimg provisioners ,to install packages through automation once instance can be created
3.the behaviour of the terraform is:
to rerun the terraform,terraform will destroy current instance and recreate the instance.


now null_resource will come into the picture to run provisioner without creating an instance.

first remove sudo(root privilige) of any package and then run,instance create and it shows an error.
then add sudo of that package and then run ,destroy and recreate the instance and installed the package.
so here to decouple

* terraform will not destroy the instance and recreate.
* provisoner will run again and again.

* increasing the instances depends on instance type (like t3.micro,t3.small,...) cost will be high.
so in organizations first they will check the capacity to store the instances.
Spot Instances offer up to 90% discount but carry the risk of interruption:
unable to store data in database in spot instances
spot instance advisor:search in google
Reserved Instances offer up to 72% decreased rates with high availability, but long commitment periods.
